Source code:
    SenderCount.java 
    SenderCountMapper.java 
    SenderCountReducer.java

Elapsed time:
    results are in the file, log_elapsed

Top 100 results:
    command: sort -nr -k2 results_hd | head -n 100 > results_hd_top100
    results are in the file, results_hd_top1000

How to verify: 
    In result/ directory
    verify.sh compares the results from hadoop, results_hd, to the verified file, log_hd_sorted, which I generate by my own. I use the linux commands, such as sort, awk and diff, to finish the job. It takes 25 minutes to finish all verification work.
